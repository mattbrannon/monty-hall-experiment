# Monty hall experiment

The question:
- Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The answer: 
- Yes.

The reason: 
- Switching doors in this scenario gives you about 66% chance of winning

Try it and see for yourself. If you play 100 round of this game, on average you'll win 2 out of every 3.
