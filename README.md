# Monty hall experiment

The question:
- Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The answer: 
- **Yes**.

The reason: 
- Switching doors in this scenario gives you about 66% chance of winning

---

If you've never encountered this problem before, the idea that switching doors would increase your chances of winning very likely seems wrong. How could switching doors increase your chances? The key thing to remember is that the game show host, **knows** where the car is located. When you make your first selection, you have a 1 in 3 chance of choosing the correct door. But then Monty goes and changes things. When he removes one of the options, he changes the initial probability.

Still confused? Don't feel bad. It's a very unintuitive problem and one that even mathematicians have gotten wrong.  
Try it and see for yourself. If you play 100 rounds of this game, on average you'll win 2 out of every 3.
